# Login Bug Fix - "User Not Found" After Registration

## Problem Description

Users were able to successfully register but then could not login, receiving the error:
```
Invalid credentials. User not found.
```

## Root Cause

There was a mismatch between how the frontend sends login credentials and how the backend processes them:

### Frontend Behavior (LoginPage.jsx)
- The login form has a single field labeled "Username or Email"
- This field is **always** sent to the backend as `username`, regardless of whether the user enters a username or email
- Example: If user enters `john@example.com`, the frontend sends:
  ```json
  {
    "username": "john@example.com",
    "password": "..."
  }
  ```

### Backend Behavior (BEFORE FIX)
- Expected either a `username` field OR an `email` field
- Searched database exactly as provided:
  - If `username` field provided → search for user where `username === value`
  - If `email` field provided → search for user where `email === value`
- **The bug**: When user entered their email in the login form, it was sent as `username`, so the backend searched for a user with `username === "john@example.com"` instead of `email === "john@example.com"`

## Solution

Updated the backend login logic to intelligently detect if the `username` field contains an email address:

### Changes Made in `backend/src/controllers/user.controller.js`

```javascript
// Smart detection: if username field contains @ symbol, treat it as email
let normalizedUsername = username?.trim();
let normalizedEmail = email?.trim().toLowerCase();

// If no explicit email field but username looks like an email, use it as email
if (!normalizedEmail && normalizedUsername && normalizedUsername.includes('@')) {
  normalizedEmail = normalizedUsername.toLowerCase();
  normalizedUsername = null; // Don't search by username if it's an email
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Login with username**: `{ username: "johnsmith", password: "..." }`
   - Searches for user where `username === "johnsmith"` ✅

2. **Login with email (in username field)**: `{ username: "john@example.com", password: "..." }`
   - Detects "@" symbol
   - Searches for user where `email === "john@example.com"` ✅

3. **Login with explicit email field**: `{ email: "john@example.com", password: "..." }`
   - Searches for user where `email === "john@example.com"` ✅

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were run covering:
- ✅ Login with username
- ✅ Login with email (sent in username field) - **THE MAIN FIX**
- ✅ Login with email (sent in email field)
- ✅ Case-insensitive email matching
- ✅ Whitespace trimming
- ✅ Password validation
- ✅ Rejection of invalid credentials

All tests passed successfully.

## Additional Benefits

- No frontend changes required
- Backward compatible with any API clients
- Handles case-insensitive email matching
- Trims whitespace automatically
- User-friendly: users can enter either username OR email in the same field

## Files Modified

- `backend/src/controllers/user.controller.js` - Updated `loginUser` function (lines 90-98)
