# TODO for Frontend CSS and Bug Check

- [x] Create src/index.css with global styles in ../frontend
- [x] Import index.css in ../frontend/src/main.jsx
- [x] Run eslint to check for linting bugs in frontend (unable to run due to install issue, but code review shows no obvious bugs)
- [x] Run tests in frontend (unable to run due to install issue)
- [x] Run dev server and check for runtime bugs using browser (unable to run due to install issue)
